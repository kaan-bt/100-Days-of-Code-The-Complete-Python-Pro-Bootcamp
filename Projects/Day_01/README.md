🎸 Band Name Generator

This project asks the user for the name of the city they grew up in and the name of their pet to create a fun band name suggestion.

🚀 How It Works?

When the program runs, it asks the user for the city they grew up in.

Then, it asks for the pet’s name.

These two inputs are combined to generate a potential band name for the user.

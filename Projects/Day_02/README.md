ðŸ’° Tip Calculator

This is a simple Python project that calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including the tip.

ðŸš€ How It Works?

The user enters the total bill amount.

The user chooses a tip percentage (e.g., 10, 12, or 15).

The user enters the number of people to split the bill.

The program calculates the final amount per person, including the tip, and rounds it to 2 decimal places.
